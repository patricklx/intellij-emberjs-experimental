/*
 * We have multiple ways of representing invokable values, dictated by certain constraints
 * of how TypeScript works. The purpose of `resolve` is to take any one of these types of
 * values and return a function of the following form:
 *
 *     (args: Named, ...positional: Positional) => Result
 *
 * `Named` and `Positional` represent the respective types of the named and positional
 * args accepted, and `Result` is either `CreatesModifier`, `AcceptsBlocks<...>`, or any
 * other type to simply indicate that the invokable returns a value.
 *
 * In the core, invokables can take one of two forms:
 *
 *  - `new (...) => Invokable<T>`: this is the typical signature for items such as a
 *    component subclass. In resolving this form, we need to break apart the construct
 *    signature and reconstruct it as a regular function, which has the implicit effect
 *    of preserving type parameters for polymorphic components in the resulting function
 *    type.
 *  - `DirectInvokable<T>`: While items like component classes can't directly be invokable
 *    themselves (among other things, their instance's type params wouldn't be in scope),
 *    this form is useful for certain complex cases that may require explicitly declaring
 *    a type rather than inferring it. Breaking apart and reconstructing a function
 *    signature as we do above will cause functions with multipe signatures to collapse
 *    down to their most general form, which breaks complex declarations like `fn` that
 *    rely on having multiple overrides to be typed correctly.
 *
 * In GlimmerX (and potentially other future environments), plain functions can themselves
 * be invokables with their own particular resolution semantics.

/*
 * A mustache like `{{this.foo}}` might either return a plain value like a string
 * or number, or it might be an arg-less invocation of a helper (or even a curly
 * component, depending on context).
 *
 * This variant of `resolve` is used for such mustaches, treating values with
 * no associated signature as though they were arg-less helpers that return a
 * value of the appropriate type.
